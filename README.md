# AI Agents Framework Summary

<details>
<summary>Agent Theoretical Foundations</summary>

### What is an AI Agent
An AI Agent is a computational system capable of perceiving its environment and taking autonomous actions to achieve specific goals. It consists of the following core elements:
- Perception: Ability to gather information from the environment
- Reasoning: Ability to process information and make decisions
- Action: Ability to execute decisions and influence the environment
- Learning: Ability to improve from experience

### Basic Agent Architectures
1. **Reactive Architecture**
   - Direct mapping from perception to action
   - No internal state maintenance
   - Quick response but limited capabilities

2. **Cognitive Architecture**
   - Maintains internal states and knowledge representation
   - Possesses reasoning and planning capabilities
   - Can handle complex tasks

3. **Hybrid Architecture**
   - Combines reactive and cognitive architectures
   - Balances response speed and complexity handling

### Key Agent Characteristics
1. **Autonomy**
   - Capable of independent decision-making
   - Minimal human intervention required

2. **Social Ability**
   - Interaction with other agents or humans
   - Collaborative complex task completion

3. **Reactivity**
   - Environmental change perception
   - Timely behavior adjustment

4. **Pro-activeness**
   - Active goal pursuit
   - Future action prediction and planning

### Agent Types
1. **Single Agent Systems**
   - Independent task completion
   - Suitable for well-defined problems
   - Relatively simple architecture

2. **Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Multiple agent collaboration
   - Suitable for complex problems
   - Requires coordination mechanisms
